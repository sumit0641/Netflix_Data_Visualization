### Technical Implementation
python
# Interactive dashboard framework
import streamlit as st
import plotly.express as px
import plotly.graph_objects as go

def create_interactive_viz(data, chart_type):
    if chart_type == 'scatter':
        return px.scatter(data, hover_data=['details'])
    elif chart_type == 'line':
        return px.line(data, markers=True)


## Narrative Construction
